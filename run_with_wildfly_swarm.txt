Instructions to deploy Sefaz with WildFly Swarm.
You need to have generated this project with selected "Packaging WildFly Swarm" option from the generjee settings page.

1. Prerequisites

You need to have JDK 8 and Maven installed properly. If you do not have these already set up, please follow the official installation instructions for Oracle JDK and Apache Maven:
JDK 8 Installation Guide: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html
https://maven.apache.org/install.html
https://maven.apache.org/configure.html

2. Start the application

Go into the generated code directory and execute the command "mvn wildfly-swarm:run". This will direct Maven to pack a "fat jar" including WildFly Swarm.
When you run this command the first time, it may take a few minutes to download all the dependencies. But next time it will be much faster.
After the application is packaged and started successfully, you can start it in your browser with http://localhost:8080

3. Tips

The generated application has a default in-memory database configured. If you want set an other database, change the JNDI name in this two files:
- src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml - Change value of <jta-data-source>
- src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/shiro.ini (If user authentication is activated) - Change the value of datasource.resourceName

If you have chosen user self-registration, you must set an SMTP server to be able sending mails to users for registration confirmation and forgotten password handling. The SMTP server and credentials are configured in web.xml.
If google mail complains about security, check if you want to set down the security level of the gmail account:  https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps.
